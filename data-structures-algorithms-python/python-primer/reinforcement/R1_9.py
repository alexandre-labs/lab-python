What parameters should be sent to the range constructor, to produce a
range with values 50, 60, 70, 80?

In the range built-in function, we have a 3º arg called 'step'. So:
start = 50
stop = 90
step = 10
range(start, stop, step)

What parameters should be sent to the range constructor, to produce a
range with values 8, 6, 4, 2, 0, −2, −4, −6, −8?

start = 8
stop = -10
step = -2
range(start, stop, step)
