def calculator():
    '''Write a Python program that simulates a handheld calculator. Your pro-
    gram should process input from the Python console representing buttons
    that are “pushed,” and then output the contents of the screen after each
    operation is performed. Minimally, your calculator should be able to
    process the basic arithmetic operations and a reset/clear operation.
