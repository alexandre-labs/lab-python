def odd_numbers(sequence):
    '''
    Write a short Python function that takes a sequence of integer values and
    determines if there is a distinct pair of numbers in the sequence whose
    product is odd.

    P.S: I did not understand that...is something like:
    sequence = [1,2,34,5,6,78,9,0]
    pair of numbers = [(1,2), (3,4) (5,6) (7,8) (9,0)]

    and should I return the pair where pair[0] * pair[1] is a odd numbers?
